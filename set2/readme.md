TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

In exercise 0 I learned about how to write with variables, strings and integers

In exercise 1 I learned how to debug and pause a line to test what it does

In exercise 2 I fixed up code that was broken. The secret word was: MC Hammer

In exercise 3 I leared how to use for loops, append things.
